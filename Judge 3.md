## UI
### homepage (5/5): [x]
5/5, simple, sexy, elegant
### overall (10/10): [x]
Not much more to say, the main UI is done to perfection
## UX
### digestability (1/5): [x]
It took me way to long to figure out where settings was, I wasn't even sure if there was a settings. No one should have to click something that says history to get a dropdown to go to settings, it should have been its own seperate menu in my opinion.
### usability (14/15:) [x]
Once you figure out where settings is, its pretty usable. I docked a point for the sidebar not being resizable because it breaks the monaco editor completions
### overall (5/10): [x]
Pretty good, but you lost alot of points for the nonresizable sidebar, and the unclear positioning of settings.
## power user
The custom theme and the prebuilt themes are nice, reminds me of your previous project, metallic, but it feels more refined. You lost 2 points for including extensions but not documenting or letting the user create custom extensions, a massive mistep for a nice feature. The eruda intigration is fine, I would have prefered something without a mobile UI, I'm not giving or taking points away for that since it seems like most submissions had that built in, though you loose another point for no panic button, a somewhat standard feature on proxies. I take away another point for lack of about:blank cloaking because thats a pretty standard feature on proxies.
### overall (5/10): [x]
## creativity
While aesthetically pleasing, I'm not sure what I'd call creative in the submission, it seems not like a revolution but rather an evolution of your previous project with metallic. Most added features were features also found in other submissions.
### overall (5/10): [x]
## out-of-card judgements
I do like the themes, and once you find the settings (I cant stress how long it took me to find them) the layout of everything is very elegant. I will give you like 3 points because 3 is a nice number
### overall (3/25) [x]

## final thoughts
Nice proxy, unfortunate placement of settings, strange lack of resizable sidebar, and unfortunate that there are no userloadable or sideloadable extensions. UI is aesthetically pleasing and after learning where things are, its nice. I somewhat question why there aren't tabs but I wont give, nor take points for that.
