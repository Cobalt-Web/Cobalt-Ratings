# Cobalt Ratings
Ratings for Cobalt in the 2023 TN Proxathon.

Cobalt won 3rd place!

## Raw Score
The scores are averaged based on the exact provided score, plus the score for the "Power User" category again (so the given scores on Power User were doubled on the scorecard). I did that so that judges didn't have to deal with an "/20" for that.

The format here is, per line (for each judge card):
```
[raw score] ([raw power user score]) [adjusted score]
```
The exception is Atom. I scored it the same but I didn't keep track of the other numbers & am lazy.

Keep in mind that "/100" is pretty arbitrary, that's just the max score. It isn't a linear difficulty of getting a higher score or something.

**Cobalt**
```md

* 53 (4) 57
* 64.25 (6.75) 71

== 59.38 / 100
