## UI

### Homepage (4.1/5)

The homepage is very functional and requires very little explanation. There are plenty of symbols that everyone is familiar with. The links work, but there is a lack of a privacy policy.

### overall (9/10)

Everything is well-designed and looks like it had a lot of thought put into it.

## UX

### Digestability (3.6/5): 

The omnibox on the homepage is very intuitive and convenient. The browser navigation is very to understand if you've used a web browser. However, it isn't immediately obvious that you have to open the sidebar to access settings/customize the experience. There are some weird things that probably shouldn't be customizable like the border radius.

### Usability (12/15) 

The browser navigation features work very well with Ultraviolet. However, the dark reader extension does not seem to work. The interface is very fast and lightweight.

### overall (8.1/10) 

## Power User

The extensions are very extensive. Being able to enter raw custom CSS is cool, but there isn't much documentation and it's only applied to the interface, not to the proxied sites. Writing CSS for the interface requires access to the browsers devtools.

### Overall (7/10)

## Creativity (3.8/5)

Homepage is dead simple. The sidebar is cool and quirky though.
