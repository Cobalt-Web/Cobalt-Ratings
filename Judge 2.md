## UI
### homepage (/5): 3
- Everything feels very flat, especially on cobalt://home, the logo looks weird being the same as the accent
- Accent color is used in places that shouldn't be, think 60-30-10, use it for some icons or buttons here and there but I would avoid using it as a background for text inputs
### overall (/10): 6
After messing around with the themes a bit, I do think that "Dune" would be a really good default theme for this, the top bar looks super sleek with it although I would change the search icon background & url bar text color
- Hover effects/click effects on the buttons would be a nice touch to add in order to give the user some visual feedback when navigating
## UX
### digestability (/5): 4
The site is very simple, very little distraction on the page
- No large blocks of text
- Simplisitic UI
- Users might be confused by the browser themed top bar with an absence of tabs
### usability (/15:) 8
- It took me a while to figure out where settings were, I would expect to see a dedicated settings button or link to a settings page to help users, especially power users find where they can modify the functionality of the site
### overall (/10): 8
Very nice experience that is simple and easy to understand aside from the difficulty getting to settings
## power user
The only "power user" functionality that I really see here is the ability to create custom themes, it would be nice to see some documentation on this or showing the current theme inside of the editor to give the user a starting point to go off of when designing a theme. I would consider extensions a power user feature if there was the ability to create your own with documentation on how to do so although I do not see this capability. The implementation of eruda is, in my view, a very low effort feature that I haven't been considering.
### overall (/10): 4
## creativity
The design doesn't stand out very much compared to other entries, several other submissions have also included a "browser like" UI, it is nice to see such a large selection of themes although it would be nice to see these be a little more polished.
### overall (/10): 5
## out-of-card judgements
I really like the sleek icons used in the nav bar, I would still change the background on the search icon and the text color in the URL bar but other than that the layout is quite good. It would be nice to see some more power user features such as the ability to create custom extensions as well as have documentation on the themes. Its nice to see proxies made with modern technologies coming out although I would like to see typescript and tsx being used.
