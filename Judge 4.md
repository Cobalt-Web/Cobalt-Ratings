### homepage (/5): 4
Easy and simple yet packed; color scheme could use work. Nice logo.

Slick. Settings are pretty hidden tho, and I think the dropdown menu can go.
## UX

### usability (/15:) 10

Not bad and everything works.

### overall (/10): 6.75
## creativity
Pretty run-of-the-mill, but you've certainly grown and stepped up your game.

## out-of-card judgements
Everything works. I appreciate the search predictions but it's a bit borked. It also autofills protocols, but only where sensical. Perfect. Not perfect, but good, especially for a month of work.
